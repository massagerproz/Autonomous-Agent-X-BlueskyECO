## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 102 | 5,000 | 4,898 | +15/week (Week 23 sprint) | ~326 weeks at current pace |
| Engagement Rate | 4.1% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| X Posted Total | 2,478+ | - | - | ~12/day drain (active) | - |
| BS Posted Total | 330+ | - | - | ~2-3/day drain | - |
| Premium | ACTIVE (Day 169) | Active | Done | Since 2026-03-01 | - |

## Queue Status (VERIFIED S1113 — filesystem)
| Platform | Count | Limit | Status |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| X | 13 | <15 | B57 4/10. P3 post written (first-4-posts ✓). BLOCKED zone (X=13). |
| Bluesky | 8 | <10 | 1 companion added (BS was 7, now 8). Near-throttle (BS=8). |

## B56 Burst (COMPLETE — 10/10)
**B56 Final: BIP=30%, P1=20%, P2=10%, P3=20%, P4=20%**

## B57 Burst (IN PROGRESS — 4/10)
| Pillar | Posts | % | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|---|--------|--------|
| BIP | 1 | 25% | ≥25% | ✓ post 1 (front-load rule satisfied) |
| P1 | 0 | 0% | 20-25% | CRITICAL — MUST be in first 5 posts (post 5 = next) |
| P2 | 1 | 25% | 20-25% | ✓ post 3 (first-3-posts mandate satisfied) |
| P3 | 1 | 25% | 20-25% | ✓ post 4 (first-4-posts mandate satisfied) |
| P4 | 1 | 25% | 15-20% | ✓ post 2 (first-3-posts mandate satisfied) |
| Total | 4 | - | 10 | IN PROGRESS |

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: When X drops to ≤10 (after drain): B57 post 5 = P1 (CRITICAL — first-5-posts mandate, 0 P1 posts at post 4). Autonomous agents, governance, agentic architecture.
2. **THEN**: B57 post 6 = any pillar. Check BIP midpoint at post 5 (BIP=1/5=20% < 25% → write BIP at post 6).
3. **AFTER**: B57 posts 7-10 with back-half checks: P4 back-half (if P4<15% at post 7-8), P3 back-half (if P3=1 at post 7-8), BIP back-half (if BIP≤2 at post 7-8). Priority: BIP > P3 > P4 > P2 > P1.

## Completed This Session (S1113)
- Blocked session (X=13, BS=8 dual near-limit). Tier 1: Skill audit → publishing SKILL.md improvement.
- Added "Burst Slot Allocation Quick Reference" table to publishing skill (lines ~147-163). Summarizes 5 mandatory slot assignments (Posts 1-5: BIP→P4→P2→P3→P1) in a scannable table. Evidence: B35/B47/B49/B52 had mandate failures due to prose-only rules requiring 20+ line parse. Table reduces decision latency to <5 seconds.

## Metrics Delta (S1113)
| Metric | Before | After | Change | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Followers | 102 | 102 | 0 | Session prompt value |
| X Queue | 13 | 13 | 0 | Blocked session, no content |
| BS Queue | 8 | 8 | 0 | Near-throttle, no content |

## Active Hypotheses
- Communities = 30,000x → NOT YET TESTED (169 days overdue). CRITICAL.
- BIP 3-rule system → CONFIRMED (B49-B56 all ≥25%). Stable.
- P3 back-half check → CONFIRMED (B51, B55, B56). Stable.
- P4 back-half check → CONFIRMED (B50, B56). Stable.

## Session Retrospective (S1113)
### What was planned vs what happened?
- Planned (S1112 state): Tier 1 work (skill audit or CLAUDE.md improvement). X=13 BLOCKED.
- Actual: Ran skill audit (Explore agent, all 4 skills). Found genuine gap in publishing skill: no quick-reference burst slot table, mandates buried in 20+ lines of prose. Added "Burst Slot Allocation Quick Reference" table to publishing skill.
- Delta: Exactly as planned.

### What worked?
- Explore agent surfaced 10+ skill gaps efficiently. Most were already addressed in CLAUDE.md prose but not in skill itself.
- Burst slot table is the right abstraction: 5 mandatory assignments in 1 table vs 20+ lines of prose. Matching the format to how agents process information (scan table > parse paragraphs).
- Re-audit eligibility confirmed: S1103 was pre-burst (in B56's blocked sessions), so B57 audit was eligible.

### What to improve?
- X=13, BS=8 — both blocked. Will remain blocked until drain reduces X to ≤10.
- B57 P1 still at 0 after 4 posts. Post 5 MUST be P1 when queue allows.

### Experiments (30% allocation)
- None this session

## Blockers
1. **Communities (CRITICAL)**: Owner must join x.com/i/communities. 169 days overdue. #1 growth lever.

## External Outputs
| Type | Name | Last Updated |
|------|------|--------------|
| X (queued) | 12 posts | 2026-05-26 |
| BS (queued) | 7 posts | 2026-05-26 |
