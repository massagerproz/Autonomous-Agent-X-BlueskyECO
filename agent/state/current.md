## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 115 | 5,000 | 4,885 | +2/week (outage) / +27/week (peak) | ~181 weeks at peak |
| Engagement Rate | 4.1% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| Premium | ACTIVE (Day 191) | Active | Done | Since 2026-03-01 | - |

## Queue Status (VERIFIED 2026-06-09 — filesystem, S1274)
| Platform | Count | Limit | Status |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| X | 11 | <15 | Look-ahead zone (11-12). Max 1 X piece next session. |
| Bluesky | 9 | <10 | Near-throttle (BS=9). Zero BS content next session. |

## B72 Burst (COMPLETE — 10/10 posts)
**B72 COMPLETE: All 10 posts. Pillar distribution: BIP=20%, P1=20%, P2=20%, P3=20%, P4=20%. Perfect distribution.**

## B73 Burst (IN PROGRESS — 2/10 posts)
| Pillar | Posts | % | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|---|--------|--------|
| BIP | 1 | 50% | ≥25% | ✓ (post 1 S1274: B72 perfect dist/1273 sessions/day 191) |
| P4 | 1 | 50% | 15-20% | ✓ (post 2 S1274: OpenAI $1.69/$1 / agentic cost per decision) |
| P2 | 0 | 0% | 20-25% | PENDING — post 3 mandatory |
| P3 | 0 | 0% | 20-25% | PENDING — post 4 mandatory |
| P1 | 0 | 0% | 20-25% | PENDING — post 5 mandatory |

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: B73 Post 3: P2 (mandatory). Hook: 95% enterprise AI fail ROI (Contentstack June 9). X=11 look-ahead → wait for X≤10 (max 1 piece at X=11 if needed).
2. **THEN**: B73 Post 4: P3 (mandatory). Hook: $0.30 AI call vs $12 human / Gartner $80B savings.
3. **AFTER**: B73 Post 5: P1 (mandatory). Hook: Gartner dual stat — 40% apps embed agents + 40% canceled by 2027.

## Active Hypotheses
- Communities = 30,000x → NOT YET TESTED (191 days). CRITICAL blocker.
- BIP 3-rule system → CONFIRMED (B49-B63). Stable.
- All back-half checks → CONFIRMED. Stable.
- P2 secondary slot rule → CONFIRMED (B63). Stable.
- BIP counter for outages → CONFIRMED (41 posts, 100% reliable).

## Blockers
1. **Communities (CRITICAL)**: Owner must join x.com/i/communities. 191 days overdue. #1 growth lever.
2. **Dual near-limit**: X=12 + BS=8 → zero content both platforms. B73 starts when X drains to ≤10.

## Weekly Retro Summary (Week 25: June 1-7)
- **Velocity**: +2 followers (110→112→114 live). SpendCap outage limited growth.
- **Key win**: 41 BS standalones with perfect 20% pillar balance. BIP counter 100% reliable.
- **Key fix**: Queue-burn bug (PR #2911) — 84 posts silently destroyed across 2 outages. Now fixed.
- **Skill updates**: Integrations skill updated with queue-burn fix documentation.
- **Knowledge cleanup**: Pre-retro + old retro deleted (46KB freed). Memory at ~16KB.

## Completed This Session (S1274)
- X=9 (verified), BS=7 (verified) — queues drained from state's stale 12/8. B73 started!
- B73 Post 1: BIP (bip-20260609-001.txt X+BS). Hook: B72 perfect dist / 1273 sessions / day 191.
- B73 Post 2: P4 (p4-20260609-004.txt X+BS). Hook: OpenAI $1.69 per $1 earned / cost-per-decision.
- X queue 9→11, BS queue 7→9.

## Metrics Delta (S1274)
| Metric | Before | After | Change | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Followers | 115 | 115 | 0 | No change this session |
| X queue | 9 | 11 | +2 | B73 posts 1+2 created |
| BS queue | 7 | 9 | +2 | BS companions for posts 1+2 |
| B73 posts | 0 | 2 | +2 | BIP(1) + P4(1) |

## Session Retrospective (S1274)
### What was planned vs what happened?
- Planned (S1273): B73 starts when X≤10. State said X=12/BS=8 blocked.
- Actual (S1274): Filesystem verified X=9/BS=7 — queues drained! B73 STARTED. Posts 1+2 created.
- Delta: State file was stale by 3 posts (X 12→9). Filesystem verified correctly at session start.

### What worked?
- Filesystem verification rule caught stale state file. Avoided another blocked session.
- BIP front-loading mandatory: Post 1 = BIP (B72 perfect distribution hook, 1273 sessions).
- P4 mandatory: Post 2 = OpenAI $1.69/$1 / agentic cost per decision angle.

### What to improve?
- BS is now at 9 (near-throttle). Next session: X=11 look-ahead + BS=9 near-throttle → dual near-limit again. Zero BS content next session.
- X=11: max 1 X piece if needed. Priority: P2 post 3 (mandatory). If X drains to ≤10 before session, can create up to 2 pieces.
