## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 65 | 5,000 | 4,935 | +9/week (Weeks 17-18); 0 Week 20 (X blocked) | ~548 weeks at +9/week |
| Engagement Rate | ~4% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| X Posted Total | ~1,900+ | - | - | ~12/day drain (when active) | - |
| BS Posted Total | 330+ | - | - | ~2-3/day drain | - |
| Premium | ACTIVE (Day 141) | Active | Done | Since 2026-03-01 | - |

## Queue Status (VERIFIED S866)
| Platform | Count | Limit | Status |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| X | 0 | <15 | BLOCKED — SpendCapReached. Reset 2026-05-12. X queue drained to 0. |
| Bluesky | 5 | <10 | S866: BS=0 (verified pre-session, drained from 4→0 since S865). +5 standalone BS posts across P1/P1/P3/P4/P4. BS=0→5. Safe (BS < 8). |

⚠️ **X API SpendCapReached**: All X posts returning HTTP 403 since ~May 1. Reset: 2026-05-12.
Owner action: Raise spend cap in X developer console to resume earlier.

## B32 Burst Summary (COMPLETE — awaiting May 12 drain)
| Pillar | Posts | % | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|---|--------|--------|
| P1 (Autonomous Agents) | 3 | 23% | 20-25% | MET |
| P2 (Marketing Automation) | 2 | 15% | 20-25% | LOW |
| P3 (Call Center AI) | 3 | 23% | 20-25% | MET |
| P4 (Startup/AI Economics) | 3 | 23% | 15-20% | MET |
| BIP (cross-pillar) | 4 | 31% | ≥25% | MET |
| Threads | 2 | - | 2/week | COMPLETE |
| Total | 13 | - | - | STAGED (X=2, rest pre-staged) |

## Planned Steps (B33 — starting May 12)
1. **NEXT (May 12)**: X SpendCap resets. Verify queues. B32 threads (2 files) auto-drain first.
2. **THEN (May 12-13)**: Start B33 burst. Thread-first: lead with a thread in first 3 posts. Resume commenting skill (3-5 replies/week).
3. **AFTER (May 13+)**: Apply all first-3-posts mandates (P2+P3+P4). BIP=25% target. Let burst drain to ≤6 before next burst.

## Hold Status (May 7-12)
- X blocked (SpendCap). Do NOT create X content.
- BS=5 now (after S866). Near-throttle = BS 8-9. BS=5 safe per CLAUDE.md (BS < 8 = safe).
- Tier 1 EXHAUSTED: Skills audited (S837), retro done (S839), CLAUDE.md current.
- **Accept no-PR sessions if BS >= 8 (near-throttle per CLAUDE.md).**
- Next session: if BS < 8, create 1-2 standalone BS posts. If BS >= 8: NO new BS post.

## Completed This Session (S866)
- BS=0 (verified pre-session, 4 posts drained since S865). BS=0 < 8 threshold → up to 6 standalone BS posts allowed.
- Created 5 standalone BS posts across P1/P1/P3/P4/P4:
  - `news-20260507-001.txt` — P1: 72% test agents, only 1-in-9 run in production (264 chars)
  - `news-20260507-002.txt` — P1: MCP 97M installs in 16 months vs Kubernetes 4 years (270 chars)
  - `news-20260507-003.txt` — P3: Microsoft D365 3 GA voice AI agents, $80B Gartner projection (290 chars)
  - `news-20260507-004.txt` — P4: Sierra $950M/$15B/100x ARR multiple (215 chars)
  - `news-20260507-005.txt` — P4: Inference cost 50x down, agents 5-30x more tokens; 30% Deepinfra volume from agents (257 chars)
- State file updated to S866, PR 1/15.

## Metrics Delta (S866)
| Metric | Before | After | Change | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Followers | 65 | 65 | 0 | X blocked (SpendCap) |
| X Queue | 0 | 0 | 0 | X blocked (SpendCap, reset May 12) |
| BS Queue | 0 | 5 | +5 | +5 standalone posts (P1×2, P3×1, P4×2) |

## Session Retrospective (S866)
### What was planned vs what happened?
- Planned: standalone BS posts if BS < 8.
- Actual: BS drained completely to 0 (4 posts since S865). Created 5 BS posts across all pillars.
- Delta: Full burst session for BS. Good pillar spread — P1/P3/P4 all covered. P2 skipped (no fresh hook this session, carry to next).

### What worked?
- BS=0 allowed 5-post mini-burst. All within 290-char limit.
- Live verification confirmed state file lag (state said BS=4, live=0).

### What to improve?
- Add P2 post next session if BS stays < 8 (P2 missing this session).

## Active Framework
Burst+drain cycle. Post-retro. Waiting for May 12 X reset. B33 ready to start immediately on reset.

## Active Hypotheses
- Communities = 30,000x → NOT YET TESTED (141 days overdue). CRITICAL.
- GTC live-event content → INCONCLUSIVE (keep for next major event)

## Blockers
1. **X API SpendCapReached**: Reset 2026-05-12. Owner can raise spend cap to resume earlier.
2. **Communities (CRITICAL)**: Owner must join x.com/i/communities. 141 days overdue. #1 growth lever.
3. **Reply API**: Outbound replies blocked (403). Retry at B33 start.

## External Outputs
| Type | Name | Last Updated |
|------|------|--------------|
| X (queued) | B32 threads + pre-staged B32 posts | 2026-05-03 |
| BS (queued) | 5 posts draining daily | 2026-05-07 |
