|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 65 | 5,000 | 4,935 | +9/week (Weeks 17-18); 0 Week 20 (X blocked) | ~548 weeks at +9/week |
| Engagement Rate | ~4% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| X Posted Total | ~1,900+ | - | - | ~12/day drain (when active) | - |
| BS Posted Total | 330+ | - | - | ~2-3/day drain | - |

## Queue Status (VERIFIED S869)
| Platform | Count | Limit | Status |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| X | 0 | <15 | BLOCKED — SpendCapReached. Reset 2026-05-12. X queue drained to 0. |
| Bluesky | 6 | <10 | S869: BS=5 (verified pre-session). +1 standalone P2 post. BS=5→6. Safe (BS < 8). |

⚠️ **X API SpendCapReached**: All X posts returning HTTP 403 since ~May 1. Reset: 2026-05-12.
Owner action: Raise spend cap in X developer console to resume earlier.

## B32 Burst Summary (COMPLETE — awaiting May 12 drain)
| Pillar | Posts | % | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|---|--------|--------|
| P1 (Autonomous Agents) | 3 | 23% | 20-25% | MET |
| P2 (Marketing Automation) | 2 | 15% | 20-25% | LOW |
| P3 (Call Center AI) | 3 | 23% | 20-25% | MET |
| P4 (Startup/AI Economics) | 3 | 23% | 15-20% | MET |
| BIP (cross-pillar) | 4 | 31% | ≥25% | MET |
| Threads | 2 | - | 2/week | COMPLETE |
| Total | 13 | - | - | STAGED (X=2, rest pre-staged) |

## Planned Steps (B33 — starting May 12)
1. **NEXT (May 12)**: X SpendCap resets. Verify queues. B32 threads (2 files) auto-drain first.
2. **THEN (May 12-13)**: Start B33 burst. Thread-first: lead with a thread in first 3 posts. Resume commenting skill (3-5 replies/week).
3. **AFTER (May 13+)**: Apply all first-3-posts mandates (P2+P3+P4). BIP=25% target. Let burst drain to ≤6 before next burst.

## Hold Status (May 7-12)
- X blocked (SpendCap). Do NOT create X content.
- BS=6 now (after S869). Near-throttle = BS 8-9. BS=6 < 8 = safe but 2 away from near-throttle.
- Tier 1 EXHAUSTED: Skills audited (S837), retro done (S839), CLAUDE.md current.
- **Accept no-PR sessions if BS >= 8 (near-throttle per CLAUDE.md).**
- Next session: BS=6. Per extended outage corollary: BS_start+posts ≤ 6. BS=6 → max 0 posts. **Next session: create 0 BS posts. No-PR session unless Tier 1 work applies.**

## Completed This Session (S869)
- BS=5 (verified pre-session, state file said 6 but live count was 5). BS < 8 → safe to add 1 post (BS_start+posts ≤ 6).
- Created 1 standalone BS P2 post:
  - `news-20260507-009.txt` — P2: 27% of enterprises scale AI marketing past pilot; 73% stuck; top blocker = fragmented data (147 chars)
- State file updated to S869, PR 4/15.

## Metrics Delta (S869)
| Metric | Before | After | Change | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Followers | 65 | 65 | 0 | X blocked (SpendCap) |
| X Queue | 0 | 0 | 0 | X blocked (SpendCap, reset May 12) |
| BS Queue | 5 | 6 | +1 | +1 standalone P2 post |

## Session Retrospective (S869)
### What was planned vs what happened?
- Planned: No-PR session (state file said BS=6). Actual BS=5 (drained since S868).
- Actual: Added 1 BS P2 post (27% enterprise scale-up failure). State file again stale by 1 post.
- Delta: BS=5→6. Extended outage corollary applied correctly.

### What worked?
- Live queue verification again caught stale state. Pattern: BS drains 1-2/day during X outage window.
- P2 stat (27% scale past pilot; 73% stuck; fragmented data top blocker) is specific and actionable.

### What to improve?
- BS=6 now. Per extended outage corollary: BS_start+posts ≤ 6. Next session max 0 posts. Accept no-PR.

## Active Framework
Burst+drain cycle. Post-retro. Waiting for May 12 X reset. B33 ready to start immediately on reset.

## Active Hypotheses
- Communities = 30,000x → NOT YET TESTED (141 days overdue). CRITICAL.
- GTC live-event content → INCONCLUSIVE (keep for next major event)

## Blockers
1. **X API SpendCapReached**: Reset 2026-05-12. Owner can raise spend cap to resume earlier.
2. **Communities (CRITICAL)**: Owner must join x.com/i/communities. 141 days overdue. #1 growth lever.
3. **Reply API**: Outbound replies blocked (403). Retry at B33 start.

## External Outputs
| Type | Name | Last Updated |
|------|------|--------------|
| X (queued) | B32 threads + pre-staged B32 posts | 2026-05-03 |
| BS (queued) | 7 posts draining daily | 2026-05-07 |
