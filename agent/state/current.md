## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 110 | 5,000 | 4,890 | +27/week (Week 24 record) | ~181 weeks |
| Engagement Rate | 4.1% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| Premium | ACTIVE (Day 178) | Active | Done | Since 2026-03-01 | - |

## Queue Status (VERIFIED S1172 — filesystem)
| Platform | Count | Limit | Status |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| X | 13 | <15 | Near-limit. ZERO new content. |
| Bluesky | 8 | <10 | Near-throttle. ZERO BS content. |

## B66 Burst (IN PROGRESS — ~13 posts queued — SEVERELY IMBALANCED)
**WARNING: P4 and P3 are severely over-represented. P2, BIP, P1 all critically below target.**

| Pillar | Posts | % | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|---|--------|--------|
| BIP | 1 | 8% | ≥25% | CRITICALLY BELOW — needs 2-3 more in next burst |
| P4 | 6 | 46% | 15-20% | SEVERELY OVER — skip P4 in B67 until corrected |
| P3 | 5 | 38% | 20-25% | SEVERELY OVER — skip P3 in B67 until corrected |
| P1 | 1 | 8% | 20-25% | BELOW — needs 2-3 more in B67 |
| P2 | 0 | 0% | 20-25% | CRITICALLY MISSING — must be FIRST post in B67 (not just first-3-posts mandate; literally post 1 or 2) |

**B67 CORRECTION PROTOCOL:**
- Post 1: P2 (not BIP — P2 has zero posts in B66, must be compensated immediately)
- Post 2: BIP (front-load)
- Post 3: P1 (or P2 second slot)
- Post 4: P1
- Posts 5-10: Avoid P4 and P3 until their combined % drops below 30%
- Note: This OVERRIDES the standard burst mandate order for B67 only

## B65 Burst (COMPLETE — 10/10 — FINAL)
| Pillar | Posts | % | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|---|--------|--------|
| BIP | 2 | 20% | ≥25% | 20%↓ |
| P4 | 2 | 20% | 15-20% | 20%✓ |
| P2 | 2 | 20% | 20-25% | 20%✓ |
| P3 | 2 | 20% | 20-25% | 20%✓ |
| P1 | 2 | 20% | 20-25% | 20%✓ |

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: Wait for queue drain (X=13→≤10). No content this session.
2. **THEN**: B67 START with P2 first (correction for B66 P2=0%). Then BIP, then P1.
3. **AFTER**: B67 mid-burst: avoid P3 and P4 until their burst % drops to ≤25%.

## Active Hypotheses
- Communities = 30,000x → NOT YET TESTED (178 days overdue). CRITICAL.
- BIP 3-rule system → CONFIRMED (B49-B63). Stable.
- All back-half checks → CONFIRMED. Stable.
- P2 secondary slot rule → CONFIRMED (B63). Stable.

## Blockers
1. **Communities (CRITICAL)**: Owner must join x.com/i/communities. 178+ days overdue. #1 growth lever.
2. **B66 burst imbalance**: P4=46%, P3=38% — both at 2-3x target. B67 must compensate (P2-first, BIP-second, avoid P3/P4 first 5 posts).

## Session Retrospective
### What was planned vs what happened?
- Planned: Wait for queue drain (X=13, BS=8 blocked)
- Actual: Blocked session. Applied Tier 1 CLAUDE.md improvement: added Burst Distribution Pre-Check rule to prevent B66-style pillar imbalance.
- Delta: Identified root cause of B66 failure (P4=46%, P3=38%, P2=0%) — no explicit rule requiring burst distribution check before pillar selection.

### What worked?
- Queue rule correctly identified dual near-limit zone (X=13, BS=8) → Tier 1 protocol applied
- Root cause analysis of B66 imbalance → actionable CLAUDE.md fix

### What to improve?
- B67 must apply B67 correction protocol (P2 first, BIP second, avoid P3/P4 in first 5 posts)
- Verify improvement effectiveness in B67 (burst distribution pre-check firing correctly)
